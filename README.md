# Lab-02

## WHAT WE'RE DOING

You're getting your sea legs with

- `System.out.print`
- `System.out.println`
- `System.out.printf`
- Java Math method calls
- other helper method calls

---

## OUTPUT METHODS

### REVIEW

We talked about `print`, `println`, and `printf` in lecture on Wednesday.

Your instructor will:

- briefly review their use,
- introduce two (`-` and `+`) _format specifier flags_; you are expected to find others on your own
- introduce this course's use of the `main` and `run` methods, which differs from what is shown in the text.

### PRACTICE

Do the following drills on REPL.IT to practice using output methods:

- lab-01 : print practice : 01
- lab-01 : printf practice : 01
- lab-01 : printf practice : 02

## MATH METHODS

### REVIEW

We introduced a number of Math methods in lecture on Wednesday.

Your instructor will do a brief review of their use and demonstrate where to find the API for Java's Math package - it's a collection of mathy methods that comes built-in with Java.

#### Practice

Do the following drills on REPL.IT to practice using Math methods:

- lab-01 : calling methods : 01

## HELPER METHODS

### REVIEW

Your instructor will do a brief introduction on the concept of a helper method.

#### Practice

Do the following drills on REPL.IT to practice using helper methods:
