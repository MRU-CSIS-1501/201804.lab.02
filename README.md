## PIAZZA

As mentioned in lecture yesterday, I remembered that the other Jordan used a different forum site for his classes some years back. It's much better suited for our purposes than Google Classroom.

I'd like **all** questions about assignments and skill drills to go to Piazza. You can make your postings anonymous if you wish.

Please don't paste any code from assignments or drills into your questions - error messages and output from the console are not only **fine**, but are actually **encouraged**.

You should have received an email to your <span>mtroyal.ca</span> account from the Piazza system this morning. Please do the following:

- follow the instructions in the email and set up a Piazza account
- set up your notifications to your liking: http://support.piazza.com/customer/portal/articles/1646660-email-notification-settings?t=494939
- take a look at how to post to Piazza: http://support.piazza.com/customer/portal/articles/1564005-post-a-question
- post (either anonymously or not) a piece of trivia (about anything - can be about you, a band you like, a movie you love...whatever) to the **everything_else** folder just so you get a feel for how to use the system

## ASSIGNMENT ISSUE NOTIFICATIONS

I **truly** wished assignments were pristine products, but imperfections invariably appear.

As mentioned Tuesday, issues with assignments will appear in the `Issues` tab of the instruction page on Github...but then that puts the onus on _you_ to check in periodically to see if there are any new issues. Wouldn't it be nice if you could be notified automatically when new issues appeared?

I think you see where this is going.

To get automatic notifications, you need to do the following:

1. Sign up for a Github account (it's free and you're going to need one anyway for some of our future courses)
1. After you have a Github account, you can be notified of **new** issues for **any** assignment by doing the following:
   1. logging in to Github
   1. going to the assignment page on Github
   1. clicking on the `Watch` button and then choosing `Watching`

That's it.
